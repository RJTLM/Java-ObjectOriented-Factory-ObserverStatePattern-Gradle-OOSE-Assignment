## Java-ObjectOriented-Factory-ObserverStatePattern-Gradle

This repository contains the implementation of a Bike Shop simulation project for the Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE) course, Semester 1, 2024. The project demonstrates the application of various design patterns including Factory, Observer, and State patterns using Java. The project is built and managed using Gradle.

### Project Overview

The Bike Shop simulation includes functionalities for selling and repairing bikes, handling various customer interactions, and managing the shop's inventory and finances. The simulation runs in an event loop, processing input messages that trigger different operations in the shop.

### Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes principles of object-oriented programming to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Factory Pattern**: Implements factories for creating objects, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.
- **Observer Pattern**: Applies the observer pattern to manage and respond to changes in state across different parts of the application.
- **State Pattern**: Uses the state pattern to handle the various states and transitions within the bike shop simulation.
- **Gradle Build System**: The project is managed using Gradle, providing an efficient build process and dependency management.

### Contents

- **src**: Source code implementing the Bike Shop simulation.
- **tests**: Unit tests ensuring the correctness of the implementation.
- **docs**: Documentation including UML diagrams and detailed descriptions of the design and architecture.
- **build.gradle**: Gradle build configuration file.
